This is a library project for The Odin Project.

Wow! I feel like I learned a lot in the making of this. I had a lot of fun. Early on I had a massive block of code to deal with generating the form for when you add a new book. I still think it is a little bit big, but making it with a loop dropped it down a little (DRY!). Making the drop down list dynamic was interesting too, although not as hard as I thought it would be.

JSON was interesting to implement, and a little tricky at first as I had never used it before. I feel like I have the basic idea of how it works, but look forward to reading further into it as I progress further into TOP.

Anyway, thanks for checking this out!
